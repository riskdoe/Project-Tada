# Project Tada

A sub par proto type for a twitch bot that im writing for my final assessment as open polytechnic
Frontend build using htmx, tailwind and some Jinja2Templates
Refreshes elements on the page just by doing a html get request.

todo: find a way to get the server to tell the webapp to update rather then requesting a update every second for each element
